NAME
    PlugAuth::Lite - Pluggable (lite) authentication and authorization
    server.

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    command line:

     % plugauthlite

    Mojolicious (lite):

     use Mojolicious::Lite;
 
     plugin 'plug_auth_lite';

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a PlugAuth compatible server in the form of a
    Mojolicious lite application (plugauthlite) and Mojolicious Plugin
    (Mojolicious::Plugin::PlugAuthLite). In the future it will also contain
    a testing interface for testing authentication and authorization rules
    in Clustericious applications.

    It has fewer prerequisites that the full fledged PlugAuth server (simply
    Mojolicious and perl itself) but also fewer features (it notably lacks
    the management interface). See the other modules in this distribution
    for details.
